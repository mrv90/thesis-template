My thesis report and its corresponding slide format; This template was created based on the Payam-Noor University thesis writing style (August 2015 edition), but it can be used in any desired application.

The main configuration of this report is the common Latex commands in Xilatex, but some bugs were corrected and fixed based on the guides of the parsilatex website.

It should be noted that before use, a general familiarity with latex and how to use it is required.
